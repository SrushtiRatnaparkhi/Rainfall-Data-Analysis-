# Rainfall-Data-Analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing rainfall data using the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to study distribution patterns and evaluate prediction accuracy. By leveraging Python-based data processing and statistical methods, the analysis provides valuable insights into rainfall trends and model performance.
The project utilizes Python for data handling, xarray for managing large-scale climate datasets, and NumPy for numerical computations. Additionally, Matplotlib and Seaborn are employed for visualizing ECDF plots and error distributions.
